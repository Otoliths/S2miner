\description{
This function retrieves Semantic Scholar \url{https://www.semanticscholar.org} data for a keyword search.
}
\details{
You can use the Semantic Scholar API endpoint up to 100 requests per 5 minutes to test your application idea. To access a higher rate limit, complete the form \url{https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api#Partner-Form} to request authentication for your project.
Current API users may have noticed that some paper requests would error out if the paper data was too large. The new service avoids this problem by, first, allowing you to specify exactly the data youâ€™re interested in and, second, allowing you to paginate through large result sets, such as papers with many citations.
